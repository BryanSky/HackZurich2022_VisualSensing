## Visual Sensing & Vehicle Health

Superficial damage to the tires, body and undercarriage of a commercial vehicle is a problem to a fleet, causing unforeseen costs or in the worst case leading to more critical problems if not resolved.

Automated visual inspection can help catch these damages, but what does the interface between this automated system and the fleet manager look like?

### Data provided

- Description of damaged car datasets with annotations 
- Pre-trained model(s) to detect vehicle's part and damages
- Validation dataset


### Goal 
Design an end-to-end pipeline that is capable of capturing images, detecting damages, and presenting this info to the fleet manager. The solution should serve a fleet manager to catch damages sooner, and provide more insight into this aspect of their operations.

### Our expectation
- Presentation with a clear problem statement & solution definition (a business opportunity potentially supported by market demand).
- Provide Illustration of results as much as possible.
- Mockup/wireframe of digital solution for a fleet manager with a prescriptive / decision making feature.


### Problem statement 

*Question:* How might we assist a fleet manager to better monitor and manage the status of their vehicles?

*Challenge:* Develop a concept that assists a fleet manager to better understand and digitally sense the health of the fleet.

*Hints:*
- Focus on identifying the right customer problem to solve, rather than jumping straight into the technical solution.​
- Consider similar approaches in other industries, could that work for this topic?​
