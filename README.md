## Challenge - Visual Sensing & Vehicle Health

Superficial damage to the tires, body and undercarriage of a commercial vehicle is a problem to a fleet, causing unforeseen costs or in the worst case leading to more critical problems if not resolved. Automated visual inspection can help catch these damages, but what does the interface between this automated system and the fleet manager look like?

Fleet Managers are operating on a tiny margin and a large source of their costs are on unplanned breakdowns and fines.
An Automated Inspection Program at a yard to perform pre- and post trip vehicle inspection can optimize the operation costs.
Let's imagine that fleets' trucks undergo a quick inspection at Yard's gate while entering. Then its drivers don't have extra responsibilities and the fleet manager is alerted of any issues or broken parts before they become issues.

Potentially the visual inspection of the vehicles can be done at the yard with an autonomous robotic arm which operates continuosly at yard level. 
Here the main task is to build a workflow from i) image capturing, toward ii) vehicle part and damages identification, and iii) UX design on how the fleet manager can make use of such a tool to optimize the fleet operation.

Here you can see example of an algorithm detecting driver, headlights, license plate, and auxiliary mirror. This is a first step toward the vehicle inspection, i.e., the vehicles' parts need to be well identified by the algorithm in order to detect any possible superficial damages on it.

In the following you see how the UX for an end user (fleet manager) might look like in a first place to demonstrate all the vehicles' parts and their status.

### Data provided

- Description of damaged car datasets with annotations 
- Pre-trained model(s) to detect vehicle's part and damages
- Validation dataset


### Goal 
Design an end-to-end pipeline that is capable of capturing images, detecting damages, and presenting this info to the fleet manager. The solution should serve a fleet manager to catch damages sooner, and provide more insight into this aspect of their operations. Take a look at the example below:

### Our expectation
- Presentation with a clear problem statement & solution definition (a business opportunity potentially supported by market demand).
- Provide Illustration of results as much as possible.
- Mockup/wireframe of digital solution for a fleet manager with a prescriptive / decision making feature.


### Problem statement 

*Question:* How might we assist a fleet manager to better monitor and manage the status of their vehicles?

*Challenge:* Develop a concept that assists a fleet manager to better understand and digitally sense the health of the fleet.

*Hints:*
- Focus on identifying the right customer problem to solve, rather than jumping straight into the technical solution.
- Consider similar approaches in other industries, could that work for this topic?
